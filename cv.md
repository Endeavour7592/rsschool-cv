3. **Summary:** My goal is to become a beginner web developer in six months. To achieve this goal, this summer I began to independently study HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also started to learn English. Today my English level is A2 and I continue to study. I also entered the RS School.

Working in IT, for me, is constant development, interesting projects and tasks, and the opportunity to be mobile.

      let result = '';

      for (let i = 0; i < message.length - 1; i += 2) {
        result = `${result}${message[i + 1]}${message[i]}`;
        } if (message.length % 2 !== 0) {
            result = `${result}${message[message.length - 1]}`;
      }
        return result;
    }
 ```
