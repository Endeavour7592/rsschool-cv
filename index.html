                    <h4>About me</h4>
                    <p>My goal is to become a beginner web developer in six months. To achieve this goal, this summer I began to independently study HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also started to learn English. Today my English level is A2 and I continue to study. I also entered the RS School. I chose the WEB Dev profession because of all the programming languages, those that are used in the front end are the most interesting for me. Working in IT, for me, is constant development, interesting projects and tasks, and the opportunity to be mobile.</p>
